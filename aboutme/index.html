    <p>Hello World! Or rather, hello CSE 111!</p>
    <p>I'm a mom of one wonderful, beautiful daughter. She is the reason I am getting my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I want and need a career that will help me provide for her and care for my family's needs. We live in beautiful Florida. I am a writer with almost two decades of experience mostly in long form fiction like fantasy and sci-fi novels. I love to talk about storycrafting, regardless of the media source. So if you ever want to talk plots, characters, themes, or how to write a book; I am here for you! I write fantasy and science/speculative fiction but I love to read non-fiction business, self help, and philosophy books. I am currently reading four books at the same time! I'm secretary of the primary in my ward with a large number of children. I really questioned this calling at first because it included taking attendance and I am terrible with names and faces and it took me six months but I can now take attendance without having to lean over and ask for help. But, goodness, do I love those kids and their families and I can say there is no place I would rather be.</p>
